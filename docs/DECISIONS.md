## D1 — Native SwiftUI app via SwiftPM (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** native floating panels (`NSPanel`, non-activating, over full-screen apps) and frontmost-app tracking
  (`NSWorkspace`) need AppKit; SwiftPM avoids a hand-maintained Xcode project.
- **Rejected:** Electron/Tauri (heavier, weaker always-on-top/full-screen panel control); Xcode project (pbxproj churn).
- **Status:** Proposed.

## D2 — Local files, one JSON per note (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** user chose "local for now, cloud later". One file per note lets the app and the browser host write
  concurrently without clobbering each other; `id` + `updatedAt` on every note are what a later cloud sync needs.
- **Rejected:** a single notes.json (concurrent writers lose edits); SQLite (more code for no current gain).
- **Status:** Decided (user). Cloud sync not started.

## D3 — Native Messaging, same binary as host (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** browser extensions can't touch the filesystem. Native Messaging only accepts the one extension id
  listed in the host manifest, and Chrome launches the host on demand, so it works when the app is closed.
  `manifest.json` carries a fixed `key` so the unpacked extension id is stable (`fmjimldgmehkakonbffiaacmpijhajop`).
- **Rejected:** a localhost HTTP server in the app (only works while the app runs; any local process or page could
  try to reach it); a separate host executable (an extra target for the same store code).
- **Status:** Proposed.

## D4 — Auto-show overlay (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** user's choice. With no notes, nothing shows until toggled (menu bar / extension icon / ⌥⇧N).
- **Status:** Decided (user).

## D5 — URL prefix matching (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** user's choice. A target matches if the URL equals it or continues with "/", so `github.com` covers the
  site but not `github.company.com`. `www.`, query and hash are ignored.
- **Status:** Decided (user).

## D6 — Chrome + Brave (2026-10-27)
- **Why:** user's choice. `install.sh` writes the host manifest into each browser that's installed.
- **Status:** Decided (user).

## D7 — Extension UX details (2026-10-27)
Made by the subagent that wrote the extension:
- New note ids come from `background.js` — `crypto.randomUUID()` doesn't exist on http:// pages. (Rejected: id in content script.)
- Refreshing on tab focus skips while a textarea has focus, so edits in progress aren't overwritten.
- Closing the overlay sticks until the next navigation or toggle. (Rejected: reopen on every tab switch.)
- Deleting a note that has text asks for confirmation; empty notes delete immediately.
- Errors (e.g. app not installed) don't pop up an overlay on page load; they show when you open it.
- **Status:** Proposed.

## D8 — Extension vs. AppleScript tab URL (2026-10-27)
- **Question from the user:** "are we gonna use extension for this".
- **Option:** the Mac app reads the active tab URL from Chrome/Brave via AppleScript and shows website notes in the
  native panel. Pros: no extension. Cons: macOS Automation permission prompt, ~1s polling, panel floats over the
  window rather than inside the page.
- **Current:** extension (built). **Status:** Pending the user's call.
